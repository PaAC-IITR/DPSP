### weekly time line for the project 
1. read about the lighthouse model of pulsars
2. understanding the WebGL and three.js and how to use them for simulation
  * follow: https://stars.chromeexperiments.com/

### Key points to work on (*updated regularly*)
1. Need to decide a platform to build the whole thing, and also need to decide a timeline.
2. Second years for time being can work on:
   * Euler differential equation solving using python or something with plotting graphs.
   * Rungen-kutta 2 and 4 methods for solving single differential and higher differential equations.
